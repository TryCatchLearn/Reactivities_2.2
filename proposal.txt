Hi Neil,

Please consider my proposal if it can match your interest, otherwise just delete this pull request and all should be fine :)

I would like to merge DatingApp v8 with Reactivities to get a clean architecture with Angular,

As mutual benefit you can assist me in the process and I can send "pull requests" of the resulting code. 


My proposals for enhancement:

Since I had tried Bootstrap and Material Design, I suggest to use Angular Material this time.

Also in a later time, maybe a dedicated Authorization/Identity project should be integrated in the clean architecture,

Here is an implementation sample:
